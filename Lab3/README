I created the left most cube using a shader with a color interpolation between red (0xFF0000) and green (0x00FF00)

The 2nd cube on the left was made using a Mesh Phong material with no color and a specular of gray (0x666666) and a red (0xFF0000) emission. 

The middle cube is a gray (0xDDDDDD) mesh phong material with a green (0x00FF00) specular. 

The 2nd cube from the right is a orange (0xFFAA00) wireframe.

The cube on the far right uses a shader to create a color interpolation between light purple( 0xACB6E5) and blue/green (0x74EBD5)
